- SFINAE stands for "Substitution Failure Is Not An Error."

- It allows certain template instantiations to fail silently instead of causing a compilation error.

- It is used to conditionally enable or disable function or class templates based on substitution success or failure during template instantiation.

- SFINAE is commonly implemented using techniques like decltype, std::enable_if, or specialized template overloads.
